I had missed my flight due to visa issues and I was traveling to South Korea in a Very important International Conference.

I emailed the customer care but according to rules it was showing extra charges (same cost of two days again). Then I called the customer care number on the booking voucher, they talked to the hotel and changed the dates accordingly, mailing me the new voucher. The process was easy and smooth.
